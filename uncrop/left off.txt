left off realizing that you can't just feed through a sequential of convs and pools nicely.
unpooling layers take in indices, which have to be returned by a pooling layer.
This means you need to keep track of pool indices outputs and use them later.
You can still use a sequential, but you must loop through it manually, not calling the
sequential directly
